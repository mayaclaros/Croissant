    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent
      shape.[2] It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
      shape of the Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough.[3] Croissants are named for their historical crescent
      shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
      in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
      puff pastry.
